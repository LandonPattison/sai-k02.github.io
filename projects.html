              This project was a part of Microsoft's Decentralized Identity Hackathon. The goal of the hack is to "build any type of app (mobile, web, desktop) using your preferred programming language that uses the Verifiable Credential REST API to issue and verify VCs." 
              This is a simple .NET web app that simply showcases just how in seconds you can be using Verifiable Credentials in your own use case!
              Received "Azure Identity and Access Management 2022" Credential for placing top ten. 
              Created with Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials, Blob Storage, Key Vault, HTML/CSS, Basic .NET Project., REST API, VS Code, Github/Github Actions.

            <h2>A&M AI/ML Allergen/Food Classifier</h2>
            <p class="time">January 30 2022</p>
            <p> An IOS application that uses a ML model to classify foods for possible dangerous allergens. Created for TAMUhack 2022.
              I helped train the ML Model to have a accuracy rate of more then 76% and also help integrate the ML model into the iOS application.
              Created with Kaggle, Swift, Xcode, Vision, CoreML, CreateML, UIkit.

            <h2>AI/ML UTD Building Specifier </h2>
            <p class="time">January 15 2022</p>
            <p>App allows users to be able to take a photo or upload a photo of a building which will determine the name of the building at UTD via machine learning and artificial intelligence.
              The hardest part of the project was by far creating the ML model which required us to take over 500 photos of UTD buildings.
              This project was created for the hackathon "HACKREASON 22". The goal of the hackathon was to create an application which will mimic common sense reasoning in AI.
              Created with Swift, Xcode, Vision, CoreML, CreateML, UIkit.

            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <p class="time">December 30 2021</p>
            <p> A personal website also allows people from all around the world to see your creativity, skills, experiences on a more personalized level. It's also a great sign of a developer who is passionate about his career.
                My plan in the future is to rebuild the website with React and implement various API's using JS.
                Created with HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS.
