      <p>
        I am a person who believes in constant learning and growth.
        Ever since I was a kid, I had a passion for tinkering. Whether, I would come home late from exploring
        my area with friends, break my dad's laptop by trying to fit an SSD, overly overclock my gaming computer, spend too much
        time playing sports. There are always things that kept my curiousity going. My first touch of programming begin at just early teens (13),
        I was playing Roblox and began learning the LUA programming language to one day build a game. I was absolutely fascinated. Even though, I had a hard time understanding.
        I kept at it. There was something about the fact that it was hard for me to grasp that kept me going. Keep in mind I was just 12 at the time. 
        I genuinely was stuck at the word variable. I couldn't understand the meaning behind variable and what it is. We won't even talk about functions.
        Since then, my skills have grown to much bigger things. I persued robotics, PLTW engineering, CS courses in highschool. At this point, I knew what
        my future career would be like. But! I just did not know exactly what specialization. As of today, I am still yearning to find this. I def. do not think this is abnormal.
        It's true at the age of 20. I don't know exactly what it is I want to do. Shocker! I do know that I am going in the right direction everyday. There are a lot of things for me to touch and get
        experience in before I decide. 
        Thanks.

        To Whom It May Concern.
