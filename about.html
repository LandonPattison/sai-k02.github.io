          <p style="margin-left: 40px"> I am a person who believes in constant learning and growth.
        Ever since I was a kid, I had a passion for tinkering. Whether, I would come home late from exploring
        my area with friends, break my dad's laptop by trying to fit an SSD, overly overclock my gaming computer. There are always things that kept my curiousity going. My first touch of programming begin at just early teens (13),
        I was playing Roblox and began learning the LUA programming language to one day build a game. I was absolutely fascinated. Even though, I had a hard time understanding.
        I kept at it. Keep in mind I was just 13 at the time. 
        I genuinely was stuck at the word variable. We won't even talk about functions.
        Since then, my skills have grown to much bigger things. I persued robotics, PLTW engineering, CS courses in highschool. Throughout college, I have done Coding Projects, Hackathons, Internships and now currently working as a Software Engineering Consultant role at BlockTrace.  At this point, I have even dablled into 
        the crypto space. From understanding the development of bitcoin, blockchain technologoy, network protocol of peer to peer networks. My future career is looking to be very exciting and filled with many accomplishments.</p>
        
      
        Thanks.
